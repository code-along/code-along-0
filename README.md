# Hello, World! in Python3

In this example we will explore "Hello, World!" in C++ and Python3

C++ programs need to be compiled.

To compile the example hello_world.c program, make sure you have the g++
compiler installed, which should be pre-installed on most operating systems.

Run the compiler on hello_world.c file:

> g++ -Wall hello_world.c -o hello_world

"hello_world" will then be created as a directory
that can then be ran as a C++ program:

> ./hello_world

To compare, the process in Python is much shorter.
There is no need to compile; simply specify in the command line that
we will be running the code using the specific version of python, python3  (instead of python2.7):

> python3 hello_world.py
