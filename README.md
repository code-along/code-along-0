# Hello, World! in Python3

In this example we will explore "Hello, World!"
programs in C++ and Python3

C++ programs need to be compiled.
To compile the example hello_world.c program, make sure you have the g++
compiler installed, which should be preinstalled on most operating systems.

Then run the compiler on hello_world.c as follows:

g++ -Wall hello_world.c -o hello_world

hello_world will then be created as a directory
that can then be ran as a C++ program as follows:

./hello_world

To compare, the process in Python is much shorter.
There is no need to compile, simply specify in the command line that
we will be running the code using the Python3 version, we will need
to run the code as:

python3 hello_world.py
